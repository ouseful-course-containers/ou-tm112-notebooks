    "When Google Maps first appeared in 2005, it existed primarily as a browser based application. Developes soon started to identify the remote Google services that the application relied on and an official API soon followed, along with APIs for other geo-related services such as geocoding.\n",

    "To call the API, we need to construct a URL according to a pattern defined by the API documentation. Then we can make a request to that URL and hopefully get the geocoded data back as a response.\n",

The main aim of this activity is simply to demonstrate that small amounts of code *can* be used to generate requests to third party online services, parse the response, and do something simple with it. However, if you do peek into the entrails of the data object that is returned, you may be able to identify recognisable things within it."
