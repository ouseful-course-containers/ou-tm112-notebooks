    "When Google Maps first appeared in 2005, it existed primarily as a browser based application. Developers soon started to identify the remote Google services that the application relied on and an official API soon followed, along with APIs for other geo-related services such as geocoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then, a wide range of other providers have opened up publicly accessible geo-related services, including openly licensed mapping services such as OpenStreetmap, as well as geocoding and geolcation services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these services are accessed programmatically using an API. Some of them, such as the Google APIs, require personal API keys which are associated with registered users and can be used to track, and bill for, usage. Other services, such as Open Street Map, and its associated [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Search/) service, still publish open endpoints that *do not* require an API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not worry in this activity about the detail of how the call to the API is constructed using Python code or how the response is constructed. The main aim of this activity is simply to demonstrate that small amounts of code *can* be used to generate requests to third party online services, parse the response, and do something simple with it. However, if you do peek into the entrails of the data object that is returned, you may be able to identify recognisable things within it."
